  WARNING!!! This script needs to be run as root in order to have effect!!!

  Possible options are:
    set_bat_thresh [BAT_N] [[LOWER] [UPPER]][--reset][-r] 
  
    [BAT_N] number of the battery (can be either 0 or 1).

    LOWER - lower threshold.
    UPPER - upper threshold.
    [--reset] or [-r] sets the default thresholds.
